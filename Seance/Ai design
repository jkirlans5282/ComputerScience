Ai design 

SQL notes:
correct output
SELECT handle.id, message.text, message.is_from_me FROM message INNER JOIN handle ON message.handle_id=handle.ROWID;

Will have to manually deal with phone numbers but whatever.


Existing conversation:
Respond based off of aggregated conversation best with texts. 
if(match)then respond key value pairs, but do contains, train against me allow for multiple matches. store in binary search tree.

Example:
User: hi (input sanitized, if new, then do contains, and or take a guess else)
search binary tree for node with text = hi
look through linked list of possible responses respond randomly? or based off other parameters.
