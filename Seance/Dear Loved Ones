Dear Loved Ones, 
	It is March 11th 2:40 AM. I have decided I can no longer continue to live. I'm so sorry, I understand that this will impact you in a deep and profound way. But I do this out of necessity. Everyday has been a struggle, to live. But never to love, Haley you mean the world to me you were always capable of making me genuinly happy. Mia, Holden, and Sydney, I love you all, I'm sorry that I can no longer be with you. Mom and Dad, I love you, you did all you could there was never a way to recognize it or stop me. None of you are in anyway responsabile for the actions I have taken. I have written this note some time in advance. I intend to complete a way to hopefully help you all cope with my passing in some small way.
	-Jacob

I wish to leave behind a legacy here it is.

Title: No one is entitled to their opinion.

You are only entitled to your argument. This is one of the most valuable lessons I have ever been taught from a teacher I both admired and hated in equal measure, Dr. Strode. We live in a time where people are afraid to be wrong. A time where total control over your digital self image allows you to distort, exaggerate and otherwaise manipulate your social media to fit the version of self you have contructed in your head, and squash any dissenting opinions, its as if every individual has been allowed to become the director of propaganda for the fucked up north korea inside their head, with them as kim jong shitting rainbows and walking on water. People are self abosorbed nitwits. Think outside yourself. No one is perfect. Be wrong, and be willing to change your mind when presented with a preponderence of evidence. Don't hate. It's taken me a while, but I don't hate, I only pity. When you can help someone its always better to do so. Officers need CIT training, people need compassion. PEOPLE NEED EDUCATION.
